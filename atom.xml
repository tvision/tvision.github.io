<p>Ciao (almost) FabPot we&#8217;re lucky to have found you.</p>

<p>Look at this new open positions for developers here @ Terravision (HQ in the center of Rome),
We have several projects mainly on the backend of our e-commerce.</p>

<h2>Your future:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Great Team.</li>
<li>Workplace young and promising.</li>
<li>Internal projects focus on quality.</li>
<li>Pride on our work &amp;&amp; rationality.</li>
<li>A team that tries to use agile tools.</li>
<li>Development with Symfony2 with the SF2 philosophy.</li>
<li>Development in a fully tested decoupled e-commerce.</li>
<li>Test! Functional/specification/unit/behavior&#8230;</li>
<li>Inspiring environment but also with cool architecture: 5min-deploy, cloud, load balancing, caching, chef, nginx, xhprof, Redis, stats &#8230;</li>
<li>Competitive salary (if you are competitive).</li>
</ul>


<h2>You:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Github account.</li>
<li>Passion and enthusiasm, creative and pragmatic: you know when to push things out and keeping the quality bar high.</li>
<li>You know MVC (Symfony2, Zend, RR, Spring, Play, Django &#8230;).</li>
<li>You&#8217;re on twitter.</li>
<li>You know some buzz words.</li>
<li>Book eater (you read books not that one imposed by the university).</li>
</ul>


<h2>We:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Exponential growth together.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Money:</h2>

<p>Although it&#8217;s premature to talk about the money (the budget has not yet been accepted), I can say that
is not important the years of experience, but the passion and the evolution.</p>

<h3>level zero:</h3>

<p>&#8220;Design pattern what? Martin Fowler who? Unit test why?&#8221; <code>&lt;800</code> €
you will have to grow up quickly, and put a hand on his conscience, if you are chosen, you will need to talk to justify why you&#8217;ve never read an article on these issues.</p>

<h3>level hero:</h3>

<p>I participate in open source projects, I think in Best Practice and I write in Gherkin, given a new feature request I never said &#8220;so easy, I&#8217;ll add another <code>if</code> there there and &#8230; there&#8221;, in the community I&#8217;m known as fabpot, I love conferences (PHP / Python / Ruby​​). Around <code>&gt;~=&lt;1800 €</code>?</p>

<h4>We are looking from <code>&gt;$zero</code> to <code>&lt;=$hero</code> as long as you&#8217;ll tent to <code>$hero</code> with <code>a * t</code></h4>

<h2>TL; DR</h2>

<p>-> Quality.</p>

<p>-> Passion (reading / studing / githubbin&#8217;).</p>

<p>-> Growth.</p>

<p>-> Ethics.</p>

<p>-> Rome = ☀.</p>

<p><strong>Contact me on g.dedonato @ terravision.eu </strong></p>

<p>PS: I really don&#8217;t like standard CV templates (as European format), I prefer a cover letter and/or a linkedin profile or homemade template.</p>

<p>PPS: read our <a href="https://gist.github.com/liuggio/4339207#file-software-team-manifesto-md">manifesto</a></p>

<p>PPPS: mmmm  <code>Exponential</code> and then  <code>a * t</code> &#8230;</p>
