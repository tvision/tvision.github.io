Ciao (almost) Brendan Eich we're lucky to have found you.

Look at this new open positions for developers here @ Terravision (HQ in the center of Rome),
We have several projects mainly on the front-end.

##Your future:
- Great Team.
- Workplace young and promising.
- Internal projects focus on quality.
- Pride on our work && rationality.
- A team that tries to use agile tools.
- Development in a fully tested decoupled e-commerce.
- Test! Functional/specification/unit/behavior...
- Inspiring environment but also with cool architecture: 5min-deploy, cloud, load balancing, caching, chef, nginx, xhprof, Redis, stats, nodejs ...
- Competitive salary (if you are competitive).

##You:
- Github account.
- Passion and enthusiasm, creative and pragmatic: you know when to push things out and keeping the quality bar high.
- You know CSS, HTML ...
- You're on twitter.
- You know some buzz words.
- Book eater (you read books not that one imposed by the university).

##We:
- Exponential growth together.

##Money:
Although it's premature to talk about the money (the budget has not yet been accepted), I can say that
is not important the years of experience, but the passion and the evolution.

PS: I really don't like standard CV templates (as European format), I prefer a cover letter and/or a linkedin profile or homemade template.
