<!-- more -->

[Apply here!!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1b0Zf1I3P7P38IHwQs3JptwxsmZx3NjzycX6akZLh6TA/viewform)

Ciao (almost) FabPot we're lucky to have found you.

Look at this new open positions for developers here @ Terravision (HQ in the center of Rome),
We have several projects mainly on the backend of our e-commerce.

##Your future:
- Great Team.
- Workplace young and promising.
- Internal projects focus on quality.
- Pride on our work && rationality.
- A team that tries to use agile tools.
- Development with Symfony2 with the SF2 philosophy.
- Development in a fully tested decoupled e-commerce.
- Test! Functional/specification/unit/behavior...
- Inspiring environment but also with cool architecture: 5min-deploy, cloud, load balancing, caching, chef, nginx, xhprof, Redis, stats ...
- Competitive salary (if you are competitive).

##You:
- Github account.
- Passion and enthusiasm, creative and pragmatic: you know when to push things out and keeping the quality bar high.
- You know MVC (Symfony2, Zend, RR, Spring, Play, Django ...).
- You're on twitter.
- You know some buzz words.
- Book eater (you read books not that one imposed by the university).

##We:
- Exponential growth together.

##Money:
Although it's premature to talk about the money (the budget has not yet been accepted), I can say that
is not important the years of experience, but the passion and the evolution.

###level zero:
"Design pattern what? Martin Fowler who? Unit test why?" `<800` €
you will have to grow up quickly, and put a hand on his conscience, if you are chosen, you will need to talk to justify why you've never read an article on these issues.

###level hero:
I participate in open source projects, I think in Best Practice and I write in Gherkin, given a new feature request I never said "so easy, I'll add another `if` there there and ... there", in the community I'm known as fabpot, I love conferences (PHP / Python / Ruby​​). Around `>~=<1800 €`?

####We are looking from `>$zero` to `<=$hero` as long as you'll tent to `$hero` with `a * t`

##TL; DR

-> Quality.

-> Passion (reading / studing / githubbin').

-> Growth.

-> Ethics.

-> Rome = ☀.

PS: I really don't like standard CV templates (as European format), I prefer a cover letter and/or a linkedin profile or homemade template.

PPS: read our [manifesto](https://gist.github.com/liuggio/4339207#file-software-team-manifesto-md)

PPPS: mmmm  `Exponential` and then  `a * t` ...
